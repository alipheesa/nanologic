# Performing operations over logical expressions

 <img src="image/Image.png" alt="Not funny" width="413" height="301">
 
Current implementation deals with logical expressions as computation graphs and performs some operations, such as:
* Computation of truth table
* Computation of index form for logical function
* Computation of PCNF/PDNF
* Computation of numerical from for PCNF/PDNF
* Minimization of PCNF/PDNF

Current implementation's functionality is extremely limited (it's basically a toy example) and this package is therefore not appropriate for any major use. 
All this was created as part of university work.

You can find implementation in both [Python](https://github.com/alipheesa/University-Study/tree/main/OS/operations%20over%20logical%20functions/Python) and [IPython](https://github.com/alipheesa/University-Study/tree/main/OS/operations%20over%20logical%20functions/IPython).
