# Performing operations over logical expressions
 
Current implementation deals with logical expressions as computation graphs and performs some operations, such as:
* Computation of truth table
* Computation of index form for logical function
* Computation of PCNF/PDNF
* Computation of numerical from for PCNF/PDNF
* Minimization of PCNF/PDNF

Current implementation's functionality is limited and this package is therefore not appropriate for any major use. 
All this was created as part of university work.

You can find implementation in both Python and Ipython here:
